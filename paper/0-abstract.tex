In the web domain, automated test suites are prone to break frequently as the web application under test evolves. Test engineers must hence spend precious time to fix them. In doing so, they typically inspect the GUI, or replay a portion of the test in order to detect where the deviation from the normal behaviour occurred. 
On the contrary, existing test repair techniques do not use any visual information of the application.
In this paper, we propose a novel web test breakage repair solution, which captures relevant visual information from tests execution, and uses it to perform automated repair of breakages in a regression testing scenario. We implemented our solution in a tool, \tool, that leverages a fast image processing pipeline and crawling techniques to support a large variety of breakage scenarios. Our empirical experiment on 2672 test cases spanning 82 releases of four real-world web applications showed that \tool was able to repair up to 81\% of the total number of breakages, with an improvement of 41\% with respect to a state of the art technique. %The result is an effective runtime detection and self-repair technique that minimizes the need for testers to surmise about where and how their tests break.
