\section{Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we proposed \tool, a novel web test repair technique based on a fast image-processing pipeline.
First, we used 2672 tests spanning 82 releases of four subject systems to collect a dataset of 733 individual test breakages, for which a repair-oriented taxonomy has been presented. 
Then, we empirically evaluated our technique at repairing such breakages. Overall, \tool was able to repair correctly up to 81\% of the breakages, outperforming a state of the art solution by 41\%, while requiring an acceptable overhead.

For future work, we plan to investigate the potential for hybridization, i.e., improving our algorithm further by joining DOM- and visual- heuristics in a single solution. 
We also intend to run a controlled experiment with human subjects to measure the accuracy of the suggested repaired. Lastly, we plan to experiment our technique with more subjects, and study its capabilities to repair mobile test suites.
