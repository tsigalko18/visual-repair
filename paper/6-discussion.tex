\begin{itemize}
\item on the whole, the potential benefits outweigh the foreseeable overhead
\end{itemize}

Limitations
\begin{itemize}
\item (We currently do not support the creation of general purpose statements, such as the ones that need input data).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Potential for Hybridization} 

\subsection{Threats to Validity}\label{sec:ttv}

\head{Internal validity} We limited the bias of having produced test suites ourselves, that could constitute a threat to the internal validity of our work, by choosing existing test suites used in the previous web testing research. This also ensures, to some extent, that the chosen object of analysis are non-trivial, therefore representative of a test suites that a real web tester would implement. 

\head{External validity} Concerning the generalizability of our results, we ran our approach with a limited number of subjects and test suites. However, we believe the approach to be applicable in a general web testing scenario, even though the magnitude of the results might change when considering different test suites and applications. To limit biases in the manual selection of the versions, we considered \textit{all} the available releases after those for which the test suites were developed for.
