In the web domain, automated test suites are prone to break frequently as the web application under test evolves. Test engineers must spend precious time and resources to figure out 1)~the reason behind the breakage, and 2)~a fix for it. In doing so, they arguably need to inspect the GUI of the web application, or replay a portion of the test in order to detect where the deviation from the normal behaviour occurred.
