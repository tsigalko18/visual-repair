\section{Empirical Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

We consider the following research questions:

\noindent
\textbf{RQ\textsubscript{1}:} How prevalent are the various breakage scenarios in practice?

\noindent
\textbf{RQ\textsubscript{2}:} How do visual-based and DOM-based test repair approaches compare in terms of effectiveness?

\noindent%\quad\hangindent=0.35cm
\textbf{RQ\textsubscript{3}:} this is research question 3

\noindent
In our study, the visual-based approach is represented by \tool, and the DOM-based approach is represented by \water.

\subsection{Subjects}\label{sec:subjects}

We selected XXX open source web applications for which Selenium test cases were available. Such applications span different application domains and have been used in the context of previous research on web testing~\cite{}.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{sec:procedure}

(1)~use \textit{many} (10-15) subjects (e.g., test suites) and only two (2) major releases. Advantage is that there is threat to internal/construct validity where applying a different repair is concerned. There is the TTV of the selection of the releases. \\

\noindent
(2)~use \textit{few} (4-5) subjects (e.g., test suites) but span multiple releases  (30-50) releases. Disadvantage is that the kind of repair applied during the evolution can greatly influence the breakage occurrences. \\

\noindent
(3)~user study to measure how effective the tool is in the identification of the root cause, and how much time it allows to save.
